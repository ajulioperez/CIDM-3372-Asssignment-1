Assignment 1 - The Shell of a Blog
What is a "Weblog?"
As the Web has grown, so too has its use as a medium and vehicle for episodic/serial communication. 

Refresh yourself on what a Weblog is here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blog

With Part II of Robbins' book, let's exercise some of that knowledge here.

The Shell of a Blog
Let's thing about the elements of a blog:

A Post - akin to a short article, a post usually has a title and content. The content is mainly text, but can include images.
A list of Posts - the Website used to host a blog, will usually have a list of posts so that the reader can follow along the chronological development of the blog
Blog entry form - Although you may not see this as a reader, the author(s) of the must be provided with an HTML form which is used to enter the information that will create the blog post
Landing/Main page - A blog usually has a home, or landing page, that greets the visitor to make it clear what will blog will be about - there are often links to other sites here too
Okay, that's at least four pages, which gives us a better exercise to target the "hypertext" aspect of HTML.

Your Task
WITHOUT ANY STYLES!!!

Usingly ONLY HTML, create the pages that would fulfill the intent of the blog elements from the list above.  You will likely end up with these pages:

index.html - the landing or main page
post.html - a single post
posts.html - a list (table most likely) of all blog posts
create.html - an HMTL form used to create new blog posts
Caveats
NO CSS AT ALL!

Also, make sure you use the following HTML elements:

For index.html and/or post.html: article, aside, blockquote, details, figure, figcaption, footer, header, img, main, section, summary
For posts.html: All table elements
For create.html: All form elements
For all pages: use images whenever and wherever appropriate
It might make more sense to review this HTML Element Reference - By Category.

Goal
The goal is to use any many HTML elements that are appropriate to the task.  I will be looking for creative and clever use of as many HTML elements as possible that still serve the main purpose of this collection of HTML documents.  Together, these pages form the basis of a website.

NO CSS AND NO STYLES! Yes, everything will look "ugly."
